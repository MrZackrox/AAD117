+ [Pesonal Identity](https://www.flickr.com/photos/117329603@N05/collections/72157648865379854/) project for AAD117. I would go and check my journal as well as I have written a bit about each image and I have some research up.

+ [Uncommon Knowledge logo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/117329603@N05/sets/72157651044678040/) for Christopher Murphys new Adventure. During our meettings we kept coming back to the word adventure so I started to delve into everything that went with it. On this adventure I found out about a lot of other stuff and this helped me arrive at an and idea for the logo of this adventure that you have imbarked on.

+ [Brand Guidelines](http://mrzackrox.github.io/AAD117_Brand_Guidelines/site/uk_brand.html) for Uncommon Knowledge. This was for a project were we had to come up with a company brand, which involved making logo, icons, style tiles and all that other bits that go into making a brand.
