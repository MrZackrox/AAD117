Design Journal for Exploring Identity


Last Semester
-------------

So with the start of a new semester I all ways like to look back on what I have done in the last semester before I start with this semester. I found that the last semester was different for me as I was being challanged in ways that I have not been before. With this course it up to you alone to come up with ideas and see them through, but last semester I found it hard to find anything in my brain worth even thinking about. This could have just been me, as usually very hard on myself and after a while when you tell yourself that you have nothing to give it seems that you stop giving. 

So with that thought in mind I want now to look at the first and work that I handed in, this was the John Baskerville project that last half the semester. With this project we learnt the basics of html and css through the us of doing itterations of the project. Each week we learnt a couple of things and we apllyed them to a new version of the webpage. Over all we had seven version were we practiced what we had learnt the day before, this then all lead to a finally version were we took what we learnt and made something on our own.

I wanted to give each section of text room to breathe so I decided to put a space in between each section. There is a term for it but I can not remember it at all. What I like most about this site is the title part as it visually jumps out at you and grabs your attention. When I was makeing this I was invisioning the busines card style, I even went all Patrick Batemen on it. I would have loved to push it further to see what it would have looked like but I just couldn't find a way to bring my ides to light. So I went for a basic busines card with only the letters looking letter pressed into the card. I done this by simple adding a shadow to the text in css.

We then 

Week 1
------

With week on starting we wasted no time jumping into our new projects for this semester. So this module is all about exlporing identity, ours and corporate identitys. We are stating of looking at our own identity first as this will give us grounding on how we present our selfs to clients etc. So with this we are given the task of creating a monogram for our selves. What is a monogram? you may ask, but fear not as I have the answer

A monogram is the combing/ overlaping of two our more initils of a persons name. This then cam become their logo which they use to present themselves to people. So in my case it going to be Z,A amd R the letter wich will woven together seamlessly.

So when I was doing some research for this and another project I came across a really nice monogram for guy called [Charlie Waite](http://www.charliewaite.com/home). I can't find it apart from on his website so you will have to go there and have a look at it. I love how the two letter combine perfectly and what I just realised is that the 'W' is actualy making the circle which is a nice thouch. I just fell that this is a perfect example of a simple but efective monogram. Now what does it mean, does the circle represent him as a person who is complete and the letters edging forward does that say he is all ways on the go, looking to come up with more ideas.

There are more famouse ones that you will know of like the Channel logo, the Louis Vuitton, the Gucci and even the MTV logo is a monogram. Though I am going to try and stay away from these as they are representing a compainies voice not an individual.

With this I got stuck into a massive Google search which lasted long than I care to amite. Though I started to find really nice personal monograms that were just amazing. The monogram below was one of the first ones I saw and I like the detail that was put into it. As you have the two letters 'A' and 'M' combined but I like the use of line wight to signify the letters more clearly. A for the 'A' it is knowen that the downword stroke to the right can thicker. Now this might be a company, but I couldn't find one using this monogram, but to me it fells more personal that the proper comapny monograms.

So I then went on and found this one below. I think someone just had a clever idea for a monogram and made it as there was no one using it. So in this monogram tou can clearly see that there is an 'H' and 'A' in it. What I like about this is the conjoinment of the two letters, it has been done so simple but it works so well. I also like the font that was used in it with the serif bits lining up to make stright lines. Then teh colour scheme that has been used to me makes it fell that the monogram is on the moon.
